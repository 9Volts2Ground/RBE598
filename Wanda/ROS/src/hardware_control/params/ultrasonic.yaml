#=============================================
# Ultrasonic Range Sensor Info
#=============================================
# Hardware pins on the Raspberry Pi that the sensor is connected to
ultrasonic/transmit_pin: 27
ultrasonic/receive_pin: 22

# Maximum distance we can measure, meters
ultrasonic/max_range: 4.0

# Sometimes the sensor needs a bit of calibration
# This value is added to the sensor range to account for
# any calibration errors
ultrasonic/calibration_offset: 0.022 # meters
