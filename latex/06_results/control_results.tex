\subsection{ Body Pose Control }
The following gain values were chosen through hand-tuning the system for speed and minimal overshoot. 

\[K_p = 1.0, K_d = 0.02, K_I = 0.02\]

\end{figure}

The body pose successfully achieves the desired orientation relative to gravity, despite the noisy sensor data. Even though the system as a whole has a high degree of dynamic complexity, the approach to commanding the body pose results in this controller behaving as expected when tuning a classical PID controller. An example system response can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:pose_control_response}. Notice the overshooting and slight underdamped behavior.
