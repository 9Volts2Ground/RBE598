\subsection{ Software }

The RPi embedded on the robot runs with the Ubuntu Mate 20.04 LTS operating system. All control software for the robot is written as ROS1 Noetic \cite{rosnoetic} nodes, written in Python and C++. A mix of custom written and open-source ROS nodes were used, as described in later sections.
