\begin{abstract}

A monocular, visual simultaneous localization and mapping (mono VSLAM) algorithm was implemented for a mobile hexapod robot that has a single camera mounted to its body via a two axis gimble. This algorithm is an implementation of the ORB-SLAM concept as introduced by Mur-Artal et al \cite{ORBSLAM}, which generates a map of the robot's surroundings while also estimating the camera's pose in that map. This algorithm was successfully implemented on real off-the-shelf robot hardware, with decent results for pose estimation while the map was being tracked.
