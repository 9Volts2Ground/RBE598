For continuous body pose estimation, the robot\_localization ROS package \cite{robotlocalization} was used to implement an extended Kalman filter (EKF). This filter receives the commanded twist vector in the ground frame, as well as IMU sensor data in the body frame, and estimates the robot's pose relative to the fixed odometry frame over time.
