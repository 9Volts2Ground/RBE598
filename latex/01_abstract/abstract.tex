Mobile hexapod robots offer versatility when navigating difficult terrain environments, but their over-actuated nature can lead to difficult kinematics solutions. We developed a solution by creating an omni-directional walking gait system with dynamically adjustable parameters. Under this system, the body pose orientation can be chosen independently of the gait foot trajectories, and the pose can be controlled using classic PID control schemes. We applied geometric-based kinematic constraints to the body pose to ensure kinematic feasibility such that all legs can maintain their workspace, while maximizing the range of body pose motion. Open-source navigation and path planning tools have been integrated with this system to provide a global motion planning approach. All of these techniques have been implemented using ROS1 Noetic software and modeling techniques, and validated on a physical, affordable hexapod robot.
